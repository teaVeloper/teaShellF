# scaffold.yml
#
# Canonical $HOME layout for exploratory but disciplined work.
#
# Design principles:
# - Top-level folders encode INTENT, not technology.
# - Exploration is allowed, but contained.
# - Promotion paths exist (playground → labs → tools/projects → attic).
# - Knowledge is separated from production.
# - Topics are not predeclared; they emerge organically.
#
# This file defines ONLY the important, stable anchors.
# Substructure inside these directories is intentionally left flexible.

    comment: >
      Production-oriented space.
      Things you build, run, maintain, or could plausibly share.
      Not a backup, but usually Git-tracked.

        comment: >
          Identity-bound environment and personal infrastructure.
          Dotfiles, keyboard firmware, shell plugins, rituals.
          Not intended for redistribution.

      tools:
        comment: >
          Reusable, non-identity-bound tools.
          Small utilities, CLIs, helpers used across multiple projects.

      infra:
        comment: >
          Declarative infrastructure.
          Client configs, server roles, automation, IaC.
          No experiments here.

      projects:
        comment: >
          Concrete efforts with a goal.
          May be work or personal.
          A project is an effort, not necessarily a repo.

      labs:
        comment: >
          Exploratory but directional code.
          Prototypes, spikes, experiments that may be promoted or deleted.

      attic:
        comment: >
          Inactive but preserved code.
          Finished, deprecated, or archived work kept for reference.

  knowledge:
    comment: >
      Understanding-oriented space.
      Study, notes, reflection, learning artifacts.
      Intent is comprehension, not execution.

    children:
      wiki:
        comment: >
          Curated, structured, potentially publishable knowledge.
          Cleaned up, edited, and intentional.

      zettelkasten:
        comment: >
          Personal, rough thinking space.
          Atomic notes, links, ideas.
          Not public-facing, less refined than wiki.

      uni:
        comment: >
          Formal academic context.
          Courses, exams, thesis work, teaching material.
          Code may live here if intent is study.

      courses:
        comment: >
          Self-directed learning.
          Books, MOOCs, workshops, guided study outside formal academia.

      deep-study:
        comment: >
          Close reading and analysis of primary material.
          Source code (e.g. kernels, runtimes), specs, foundational texts.

      topics:
        comment: >
          Subject domains.
          Languages, music, hardware, math, security, tea, etc.
          Grows organically; no predefined taxonomy.

      archive:
        comment: >
          Inactive or superseded knowledge.
          Old notes kept for reference but no longer actively maintained.

  data:
    comment: >
      Local datasets and registries.
      Raw or derived data not owned by a single project.
      Projects reference data; they do not own it.

  playground:
    comment: >
      Disposable but useful scratch space.
      Temporary experiments, unpacking, quick tests.
      Safe to delete without ceremony.

  scratch:
    comment: >
      Pure junk space.
      Chaotic, very short-lived, zero expectations.
      If in doubt, it belongs here.
